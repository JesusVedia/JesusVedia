										<p>My name is Jesus Vedia, I am a graduate from Full Sail University, 
											where I had the chance of working and learning Python as a development tool,
											 this led my fascination into the world of development, soon learning and conquering 
											 languages such as HTML/CSS/JS(JQuery), as well as experience with backend systems under PHP and MySQL.</p>

											 <p>I am a quick learner and I am constantly challenging myself, used to work under pressure, 
											 I am experienced working with all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS and Linus (Ubuntu, Fedora).</p>
											 
											 <p>Thanks to my background, I am fluent in English and Spanish, which has allowed me to assist people 
											 from different cultures and perspectives, widening my skills.</p>

										<h2>My Work Style</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My years of experience in the artistic field and design has constantly proved to me that 
										the best page should be simplistic and intuitive. My work tends to stay simple and elegant, 
										prioritizing functionality and user friendliness.</p>
									
									<p>I have always provided satisfaction to my customers, as not only am I careful to cater 
										their demands, but I fully invest myself into researching to make sure the products meets their needs, 
									   going the distance and creating different concepts in Photoshop to help my customers 
										visualize their idea before applying. </p>
									
										
									<p>My expertise over design tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator has made comfortable creating my own assets 
										in most of my projects, including animations and gifs.</p>

															<h2>About me</h2>
														</header>

														<p>I grew up most of my life attached to a computer, learning from scratch and self experience 
															software such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver, but it wasnâ€™t until I had a chance to learn 
															HTML in High School where I fell in love with the magic of programing.</p>

														<p>One day during class, we had a fateful presentation about Full Sail University, where I realized I could
															combine both my love for art and programming into one.</p>
															
															<p>Studying Computer animation gave me the skills to work on a heavy computing, helping me conquer 
															HTML and Python to develop extensions for 3D software such as Maya, as well as coding for game development.</p>
															
															<p>After graduating, my passion for programming continued to grow into a never ending hunger,I quickly found 
																myself devouring language after language, mastering CSS, JS(Query), PHP, and MySQL, as well as mastering 
																all operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS and Linus (Ubuntu, Fedora).</p>
