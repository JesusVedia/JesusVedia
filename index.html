										<p>My name is Jesus Vedia, I am a graduate from Full Sail University, 
											where I had the chance of working and learning Python as a development tool,
											 this led my fascination into the world of development, soon learning 
											 languages such as HTML/CSS/JS(JQuery), as well as experience with backend systems under PHP and MySQL.</p>

											 <p>I am a quick learner and I am constantly challenging myself, used to work under pressure, 
											 I am experienced working with all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS and Linus (Ubuntu, Fedora).</p>
											 
											 <p>Thanks to my background, I am fluent in English and Spanish, which has allowed me to assist people 
											 from different cultures and perspectives, widening my skills.</p>

										<h2>My Work Style</h2>

									<p>My years of experience in the artistic field and design has constantly proved to me that 
										the best page should be simplistic and intuitive. My work tends to stay simple and elegant, 
										prioritizing functionality and user friendliness.</p>
									
									<p>I have always provided satisfaction to my customers, as not only am I careful to cater 
										their demands, but I fully invest myself into researching to make sure the products meets their needs, 
									   going the distance and creating different concepts in Photoshop to help my customers 
										visualize their idea before applying. </p>
									
										
									<p>My expertise over design tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator has made comfortable creating my own assets 
										in most of my projects, including animations and gifs.</p>

															<h2>About me</h2>
														</header>

														<p>I grew up most of my life attached to a computer, learning from scratch and self experience 
															software such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver, but it wasnâ€™t until I had a chance to manipulate
															HTML via Javascript in High School where I fell in love with the magic of programing.</p>

														<p>One day during class, we had a fateful presentation about Full Sail University, where I realized I could
															combine both my love for art and programming into one.</p>
															
															<p>Studying Computer animation gave me the skills to work on different branches of computing, helping me learn 
															HTML and Python to develop extensions for 3D software such as Maya, as well as coding for game development.</p>
															
															<p>After graduating, my passion for programming continued to grow into a never ending hunger, I quickly found 
																myself learning CSS, JS(Query), PHP, and MySQL, as well as all operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS and Linus (Ubuntu, Fedora).
														I quickly learned that getting in touch with the CLI was one of the most important aspects of server administration, which in term got me quickly in 
																touch with server side administration and server engines such as Apache, Apache Tomcat, and Microsoft IIS.</p>

															<h2>MY TECH STACK</h2>
																<h3>Scripting</h3>
														</header>

														<p>Most of my web development (back end) is mostly focused in standard PHP development following best PSR practices, in the past I have used different 
															languages such as: Python, Ruby, Node JS, as well as JSP (Java), classic ASP(VBscript). My emphasis will always continue to be PHP.</p>

																<h3>Front End</h3>
														
														<p>As a Full-Stack Developer with a big passion for design, I understand the importance that CSS brings to the table. At the same time I have become well 
															versed in using external CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap. Node JS provides all the tooling necessary to practice continuous integration on a live 
															server to facilitate the use of SCSS. This, combined with JavaScript front end  frameworks provide powerful front end capabilities, while at the same time ensuring proper 
															web accessibility compliance (ADA and WCAG)</p>
														
															<h3>Virtualization</h3>
														
														<p>These are normally small experiments of mine, but I use Docker to virtualize development environments. </p>
